def: "A material entity of anatomical origin (part of or deriving from an organism) that has as its parts a maximally connected cell compartment surrounded by a plasma membrane." [CARO:mah]
comment: The definition of cell is intended to represent all cells, and thus a cell is defined as a material entity and not an anatomical structure, which implies that it is part of an organism (or the entirety of one).

def: "A cell in vitro that is or has been maintained or propagated as part of a cell culture." [ReO:mhb]
comment: Note that this class was re-labeled to 'cultured cell' instead of 'cell line cell', as it intent was clarified to cover any cultured cells of multicellular and unicellular organisms. This includes cells actively being cultured, or cells that have been cultured but are stored in a quiescent state for future use. In having been cultured, cells must establish homeostasis and often replicate in a foreign environment. Accomodation of this stress initiates a selection of cells fit for such challenges, wherein necessary adaptive biochemical and.or genetic changes can occur. These changes can set them apart from the in vivo cells from which they derive, and such changes will typically accumulate and change over increasing time in culture.

name: experimentally modified cell in vitro
namespace: cell
def: "A cell in vitro that has undergone physical changes as a consequence of a deliberate and specific experimental procedure." [FB:ma, ReO:mhb]
comment: This class has been re-labeled to imply reference only to in vitro experimentally modified cells, similarly, the definition has been slightly updated to reflect this. 'experimentally modified cell' refers only to cells in vitro, and not modified in vivo/in environment cells. There is currently no class representing unmodified in vitro cells (other than the parent 'cell in vitro'), or a class representing modified native cells. More granular subclassing of experimentally modified cell can be found in ReO. MHB 1.12.12

[Term]
id: CL:0001034
name: cell in vitro
namespace: cell
def: "A cell that is maintained or propagated in a controlled artificial environment for use in an investigation." [ReO:mhb]
comment: 'In vitro', translating literally to 'in glass', typically refers to a controlled, often sterile, laboratory setting where cells or other specimens are placed by some agent for the purpose of studying or manipulating them as part of some research investigation. 'In vitro' is intended to contrast with 'native',which refers to cells or other biological entities that are found in a natural setting. It describes unicellular organisms removed from a natural environement and multicellular organism cells removed from an organism, or cells derived in culture from such displaced cells.
