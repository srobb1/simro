Typically enzymes which confer resistance to antibiotics, such as Dihydrofolate reductase or Beta-lactamase, or proteins that give colorimetric or fluorescent signals are used. The Bait protein is generally the protein under study and the methods are readily adaptable to highthroughput mode." [PMID:11495741]

name: protein staining
namespace: PSI-MI
def: "A wide range of dyes have been used over the years to visualise proteins in polyacrylamide gels - Coomasie Blue and silver-staining being two classical methods. Fluorescent dyes such as Nile Red and SYPRO Orange are now increasingly used due to their superior dynamic range. Use of non-denaturing gels can allow visualisation of protein protein interactions. Several dyes can be used to specifically indicate residue modification, however this methodology will give no information as the number of residues modified or their position within the protein sequence. Examples include the use of acid fuscian or the fluorescent dansyl hydrazine to show protein glycosylation." [PMID:12015990]

This approach is based on complementation between two non- fluorescent fragments of a protein fluorophore such as green fluorescent protein (GFP) or its derivatives. Interactions between proteins fused to each fragment bring the fragments together resulting in the reconstitution of a fully functional flourophore that can be identified through fluorescence spectroscopy or microscopy."
