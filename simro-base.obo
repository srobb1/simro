def: "For 1L: formalin  100mL; water  900mL; Sodium dihydrogen phosphate, monohydrate (NaH2PO4.H2O) 4.0g;  Disodium hydrogen phosphate, anhydrous (Na2HPO4) 6.5g.  Neutral buffered formalin, usually simply shortened to NBF, has become the standard fixative for use in a diagnostic setting. It is more effective than the simple formalin mixtures as the phosphate salts present make it unlikely that erythrocytes will be damaged, and the neutral pH inhibits the formation of formalin pigment. The phosphates will adjust the pH to about 7.0 as the \"neutral\" infers, but there is no need to adjust it to this level if it is slightly different. Although the formation of formalin pigment is inhibited it is not stopped altogether, and it may slowly form in very bloody tissues, or in tissues stored for a long time in NBF without it being changed. NBF is useful as a fixative for museum and photography specimens as it permits restoration of natural colour to the specimen.

name: von Kossa staining method
def: "The method was originally developed by von Kossa,[1] and underwent several modifications. The stain principle is a precipitation reaction in which silver ions react with phosphate (not calcium) in the presence of acidic material [5] Photochemical degradation of silver phosphate to silver then occurs under light illumination. This method is not specific for calcium itself but tissues are treated with a silver nitrate solution and the silver is deposited by replacing the calcium reduced by the strong light, and so can be visualized as metallic silver. Additional methods need to be employed to confirm the presence of calcium, such as Alizarin Red, which detects calcium deposits." []

Zinc Formalin Fixative can replace the commonly used 10% neutral buffered formalin solution for routine tissue and immunohistochemical procedures. This fixative is compatible with histochemical, immunochemical, and special stains. It may be used with automated tissue processors. The zinc chloride component of the formulation increases the rigidity of cellular components to withstand subsequent processing, sectioning, and staining procedures. Tissue specimens initially fixed using 10% neutral buffered formalin solution may be post-fixed using the Zinc Formalin Fixative." []

def: "The first step in almost every investigation of skeletal phenotypes is analysis of whole-mount skeletal preparations. Whole-mount skeletal staining permits evaluation of the shapes and sizes of skeletal elements in their appropriate locations. The technique is thus the major method for detecting changes in skeletal patterning. Because cartilage and bone can be distinguished by differential staining, this technique is also a powerful means to assess the pace of skeletal maturation. This protocol covers staining of the pre- and postnatal mouse skeleton using Alcian blue and Alizarin red to identify cartilage and bone, respectively." []

name: Bouin solution
def: "Bouin solution, or Bouin's solution, is a compound fixative used in histology.[1] It was invented by French biologist Pol Bouin and is composed of picric acid, acetic acid and formaldehyde in an aqueous solution. It is especially good for gastrointestinal tract biopsies because this fixative allows crisper and better nuclear staining than 10% neutral-buffered formalin. It is not a good fixative when tissue ultrastructure must be preserved for electron microscopy. However, it is a good fixative when tissue structure with a soft and delicate texture must be preserved. Formalin-fixed tissue is normally mordanted with Bouin solution for better staining results in the trichrome stains. The acetic acid in this fixative lyses red blood cells and dissolves small iron and calcium deposits in tissue. A variant in which the acetic acid is replaced with formic acid can be used for both fixation of tissue and decalcification. The effects of the three chemicals in Bouin solution balance each other. Formalin causes cytoplasm to become basophilic but this effect is balanced by the effect of the picric acid. This results in excellent nuclear and cytoplasmic H&E staining. The tissue hardening effect of formalin is balanced by the soft tissue fixation of picric acid. The tissue swelling effect of acetic acid is balanced by the tissue shrinking effect of picric acid. When using Bouin solution, several potential problems can arise. Due to the formalin in the solution, formalin pigment may be present when viewing tissue sections under the microscope. Wet tissue should be fixed in Bouin solution for less than 24 hours. Excess picric acid should be washed out of tissue using several alcohol and water solutions or staining quality may deteriorate over time. Wet tissue fixed in Bouin solution should be stored in an alcohol and water solution rather than Bouin solution. Since Bouin solution contains formaldehyde, picric acid and acetic acid, appropriate safety precautions for these substances should be taken and regulations followed. In particular, noting that picric acid can be explosive, sensitive to friction and shock when dry and in contact with some metals can form unstable metal picrates. Under the name, Bouin's fluid, this fixative is also widely used for marine invertebrates." []
